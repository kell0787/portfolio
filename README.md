# Portfolio Project Overview

This README provides insights into my web development journey, focusing on the process, challenges encountered, and the learning experience gained while creating my web portfolio.

## Process

Throughout my development process, I focused on grasping the dynamics between HTML and the CSS libraries I employed. This comprehension significantly optimized my coding workflow, enhancing efficiency in code implementation. Despite thorough preparation, I encountered various instances of trial and error during the project. I often experimented with different code iterations to identify the most optimal approach.

## Challenges and Solutions

Challenges that I have faced in this project were learning how to use bootstrap and fully being able to customize it myself. Bootstrap can be easy once you understand the concept and get the hang of it, but for me I made multiple changes to my site depending on whether or not I could make it work. 

To overcome these challenges, I:

- Dedicated time to thoroughly comprehend the documentation and usage of Bootstrap and Materialize.
- Maintained a flexible approach, allowing for iterative improvements and adjustments based on trial and error.
- Embraced the creative process, recognizing that experimentation is essential for growth and innovation, and adjusting my website based on that growth.

## Lessons Learned

Creating my web portfolio provided invaluable lessons, including:

- The importance of hands-on experience in learning CSS frameworks and customization.
- The inevitability of spending significant time experimenting and iterating, even with a detailed plan.
- The necessity of embracing trial and error as a natural part of the creative process.
-Waste no time on the project, as trial and error is a crucial part to think about, as it is very time consuming.

## Changes Made

While creating my portfolio, I realized there were several key changes I needed to make to enhance my website:

- A color palette change to give a more visually appealing look.
- Layout adjustments following the same principles from my Figma design but with improved visual appeal.
- Elimination of white space by implementing different image layouts.
- Addition of a services section to provide viewers with an understanding of what I offer.
